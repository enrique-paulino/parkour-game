# Parkour Game

# Introduction
You can download and play the game here: https://enrique-paulino.itch.io/super-simple-parkour
In this short game you use dashing, swinging and wall running to reach your destination.


# Context
This game was created to test mechanics like swinging in a 3D space as well as wall running. I thought it would be nice to implement it as a simple parkour game with 6 levels.

# Assets
Skybox was from a free asset in the Unity Asset Store (Fantasy Skybox FREE).
